# qml-launcher

Simple fullscreen launcher for desktop applications

## Differences with the original
I have forked this project because it was missing the user-specific path.

To install, you need to have Qt framework installed. In the project directory, run commands:

```
mkdir build && cd build
qmake ..
make
```

And that's it! Now you can run the application via
```
./qml-launcher
```

Now go place it in your PATH and set up some keybinds to launch it!
